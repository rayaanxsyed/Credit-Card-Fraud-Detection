# Credit Card Fraud Predictor 🛡️💳

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based fraud detection system using **logistic regression** and **decision tree classifiers**.

Given anonymized and transformed transaction data, the predictor determines whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or legitimate based on its feature values.

The goal is to showcase how machine learning models can **analyze obscure numerical patterns** and **predict fraud** without needing access to sensitive user information.
