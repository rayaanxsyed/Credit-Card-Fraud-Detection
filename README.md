# Credit Card Fraud Predictor 🛡️💳

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based fraud detection system using **logistic regression** and **decision tree classifiers**.

Given anonymized and transformed transaction data, the predictor determines whether a transaction is likely fraudulent or legitimate based on its feature values.

The goal is to showcase how machine learning models can analyze obscure numerical patterns and predict fraud without access to sensitive user information.
